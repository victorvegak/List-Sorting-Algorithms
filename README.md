# List-Sorting-Algorithms
# Overview
This project demonstrate my learning in TypeScript by implementing sorting algorithms (Bubble sort And Quick Sort) and using key features like classes, recursion, asynchronous functions, and lists. The purpose of this software is to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and its syntax.

The software showcase both sorting algorithms and includes asynchronous functionality to simulate sorting with a delay. I also used Jest to write tests and ensure the algorithms work correctly.

# Development Environment

TypeScript: it was the main programming language used for the project
Node.js: Runtime environment for executing Typescript
Jest: testing framework used for writing unit tests
Visual studio Code: Used for writing the code.
